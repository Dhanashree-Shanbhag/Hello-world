Options for build triggers
Build job after other project build
Build job after other project build is success
Build job periodically using cron

Build environment
The first step is to download the source code from the source control and download the files
in one directory in order to compile.
Every time the build runs, the files will be overwritten hence to solve the issues if the files are latest, the best approach is to delete the exiting source files in directory and fresh download on every build.
Enable option Delete workspace before the build starts

Post Build actions
Archive the artifacts to deploy the jar or war
you can run or build other projects

some of the plugins dont come into effect still restart
8080/restart
8080/saferestart - graceful wait when the jobs are running, they will allow to complete before restart and will not allow new job
